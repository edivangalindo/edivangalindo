### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is Edivan, but you can call me Ed

I've been working in IT since I was 16, I've always been fascinated by computers and understanding how things work.

I was a software engineer for several years and about 3 years ago I specialized in cybersecurity.

I've been trying to use the knowledge I've accumulated over the years as a software engineer to create offensive security tools and automate processes whenever possible.

At the same time, in my spare time, I work on bug bounty programs where I got bounties for bugs found in big companies like Netflix, Shopify, Yelp, and Elastic.
