### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Edivan, but you can call me Ed

I've been working in IT since I was 16, I've always been fascinated by computers and understanding how things work.

I had a long journey as a software engineer, where I went from trainee to senior and gradually specialized in software security until I made a career transition, taking on the role of offensive security engineer.

I've used all the knowledge I've accumulated over the years to create offensive security tools and automate processes whenever I can.

At the same time, in my spare time, I work on bug bounty programs where I got bounties for bugs found in big companies like Netflix, Shopify, Yelp, and Elastic.
