### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been working with IT since I was 16 years old, I've always been fascinated by computers and understanding how things work.

I had a long journey as a software engineer, where I went from trainee to senior and had the opportunity to act as a tech lead on some projects.

Gradually I specialized in software security until I made a career transition, taking on the position of offensive security engineer in a company with a global presence.

I used all the knowledge accumulated over the years in the new challenge and managed to evolve quickly, creating several offensive security tools and automating as many processes and tests as I could.

At the same time, in my spare time, I started in bug bounty programs, where I received rewards for failures found in big companies like @Netflix, @Shopify, @Yelp, and @Elastic.

I've been working on developing various security tools and learning more and more about this fascinating world of Ethical Hacking every day.
